# Introduction to Quantum Machine Learning for TSP using QAOA

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled `qml_tsp_intro.ipynb`, which provides an introduction to solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) using Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).

## Overview

The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest route visiting all given cities exactly once and returning to the starting point. This notebook leverages QAOA, a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, to solve the TSP using quantum computing frameworks.

## Features

- **Introduction to Quantum Machine Learning**: Demonstrates foundational QML concepts applied to optimization problems.
- **TSP Formulation**: Maps the TSP into a quantum optimization problem solvable using QAOA.
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach**: Combines quantum algorithms with classical optimization techniques.
- **QAOA Implementation**: Detailed setup and execution of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for TSP.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representations of the TSP solution and QAOA optimization progress.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `qiskit` or `pennylane` (for QAOA implementation)
  - `tensorflow` or other ML libraries if applicable

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib qiskit pennylane tensorflow
